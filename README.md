# Project 2

Web Programming with Python and JavaScript

This project was created as part of a Harvard University training course "CS50 Web Programming with Python and JavaScript"

The project meets all the requirements for project 2 of this course: https://docs.cs50.net/web/2020/x/projects/2/project2.html

Going to the main page of the site you will be asked to enter a name by which you can be identified in the chat. Until you enter a name, you can view any topics created by other users, but you cannot write messages or create new topics.

After you identify yourself on the site, you can write messages to any of the created topics or create your own. You also have the option to delete your messages. For convenience and aesthetic design, you can choose one of the available light themes available for selection in the lower left corner of the display.

Chat with friends, look for new friends, make friends, and discuss popular topics, and all this is simple and accessible on this site.

Thanks for your attention! Have a nice chat!
